    <p>Predictions from 5 Classification Models:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> The Naive Bayes model predicts your news is: {{nb_pred}}<br> with a {{nb_proba}} probability of being real news.<br> <br> </li>
        <li> The Logistic Regression model predicts your news is: {{lr_pred}}<br> with a {{lr_proba}} probability of being real news.<br> <br> </li>
        <li> The Random Forest model predicts your news is: {{rf_pred}} <br> with a {{rf_proba}} probability of being real news. <br> <br> </li>
        <li> The Passive Aggressive Classification model predicts your news is: {{pac_pred}} <br> with a {{pac_pdf}} probability density function value of being real news. <br> <br> </li>
        <li> The Support Vector Machine model predicts your news is: {{svm_pred}} <br> with a {{svm_pdf}} probability density function value of being real news. <br> <br> </li>
    </ul>
